## Inspiration
During a hike in Joshua Treeâ€™s Cactus Garden, a friend lost the car keys, leaving us stranded without cell service as the sun was about to set. We luckily found a nice couple to hitch a ride out of the park with but it was extremely unsettling once the realization sunk in of the lack of emergency protocols and ability to contact park rangers for help. Enterprise Car Rental couldnâ€™t secure our transportation until 2 AM, and arranging transportation the following day was equally challenging. We learned from park rangers that two people had already died in the park that year (it was only January), highlighting the need for improved safety measures. Thus, I wanted to create an app to help equip hikers with the necessary information _before_ their hiking journey.
