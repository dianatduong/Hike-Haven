**Inspiration**
<br>
During a hike in Joshua Tree’s Cactus Garden, a friend lost the car keys, leaving us stranded without cell service as the sunset. We hitched a ride with tourists, but the lack of emergency protocols and contact with park rangers was alarming. Enterprise Rental couldn’t secure transportation until 2AM, and arranging one the next day was equally challenging. We learned from park rangers that two people had already died in the park that year, highlighting the need for improved safety measures. Thus, I wanted to create an app to help equip hikers with the necessary information _before_ their hiking journey.
